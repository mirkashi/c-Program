Certainly! Below is a simple C++ program to print numbers from 1 to 50:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Loop from 1 to 50 and print each number
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50 and prints each number on the console.
